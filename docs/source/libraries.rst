SDK - Libraries
===============


At the current release the SDK contains six classes

* **LocationSubscriber**: allows you to track devices and retrieve updates about their location.You can use LocationSubscriber to create subscriptions, where each one of them can be used to track a device.
* **QosAwareness**: allows you to request QoS from a set of standardized values for better service experience (Ex. TCP_BASED / LIVE Streaming / CONVERSATIONAL_VOICE etc). You can create subscriptions where each one of them has specific QoS parameters. A notification is sent back to the net-app if the QoS targets can no longer be full-filled.
* **ConnectionMonitor**: allows you to monitor devices in the 5G Network. You can use this class to retrieve notifications by the 5G Network for individual devices when connection is lost (for example the user device has not been connected to the 5G network for the past 10 seconds) or when connection is alive.
* **TSNManager** allows Network App developers to apply Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards to time-sensitive NetApps. Allows the configuration of certain parameters in the underlying TSN infrastructure of the testbed.
* **CAPIFInvokerConnector** a low level class, that is used by the evolved-5G CLI in order to register NetApps to CAPIF
* **ServiceDiscoverer** allows Network App developers to connect to CAPIF in order to discover services. It's also used internally within the SDK in order to get access token from CAPIF before interacting with services like NEF or CAPIF.
* **CAPIFProviderConnector** a low level class, that allows an Exposer (like the NEF emulator or the TSN emulator) to register to CAPIF
* **CAPIFLogger**, that allows an API provider (like NEF Emulator) to save Log information, for example capture incoming requests and responses
* **CAPIFAuditor**, that allows an API provider (like NEF Emulator) to query the Log, for example filter all the Log information for a given Network APP

Prerequisites / How to start
----------------------------

Install the requirements_dev.txt

.. code-block:: console

   pip install -r requirements_dev.txt

Make sure you have initiated the CAPIF server  (See  `here <https://github.com/EVOLVED-5G/CAPIF_API_Services>`_ for instructions).

Make sure you have initiated the TSN server  (See  `here <https://github.com/EVOLVED-5G/TSN_AF>`_ for instructions).

Make sure you have initiated the NEF_EMULATOR at url :py:func:`http://localhost:8888` (See  `here <https://github.com/EVOLVED-5G/NEF_emulator>`_  for instructions),
you have logged in to the interface, clicked on the map and have started the simulation.

Make sure that your Network App has been registered and onboarded to CAPIF. If this process is completed, then in the specified folder the following files should be present

    - ca.crt
    - capif_api_details.json
    - private.key
    - your_common_name_you_specified.crt

Then run a webserver in order to capture the callback post requests from NEF EMULATOR: On the terminal run the following commands to initialize the webserver.


.. code-block:: console

   export FLASK_APP=/home/user/evolved-5g/SDK-CLI/examples/api.py

.. code-block:: console

   export FLASK_ENV=development

.. code-block:: console

   python -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0

where FLASK_APP should point to the absolute path of the ``SDK-CLI/examples/api.py`` file.
These commands will initialize a web server at :py:func:`http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

Now you can run the
`Location subscriber example <https://github.com/EVOLVED-5G/SDK-CLI/blob/master/examples/location_subscriber_examples.py>`_
(you should be able to view the location updates, printed in the terminal that runs the FLASK webserver)
or the
`QosAwereness example <https://github.com/EVOLVED-5G/SDK-CLI/blob/master/examples/qos_awereness_examples.py>`_
(you should be able to retrieve notifications when the QoS thresholds can not be achieved, or have been restored)
or the  `ConnectionMonitor example <https://github.com/EVOLVED-5G/SDK-CLI/blob/master/examples/connection_monitor_examples.py>`_
(you should be able to retrieve notifications when user devices connect or disconnect to the netowrk,  printed in the terminal that runs the FLASK webserver)

ConnectionMonitor Library
----------------------------

Overview
###################
ConnectionMonitor library supports two events as described briefly above. The first event is the loss of connectivity event where the network detects that a UE is no longer reachable for either signalling or user plane communication. The Network App may provide a Maximum Detection Time, which indicates the maximum period of time without any communication with the UE (after the UE is considered to be unreachable by the network). The respective monitoring type enumeration and the maximum detection time parameter are shown below:

.. code-block:: console

   monitoring_type= ConnectionMonitor.MonitoringType.INFORM_WHEN_NOT_CONNECTED
   wait_time_before_sending_notification_in_seconds=5

The second event is the ue reachability event where the network detects when the UE becomes reachable (for sending downlink data or SMS to the UE). The monitoring type enumeration is shown below:

.. code-block:: console

   monitoring_type= ConnectionMonitor.MonitoringType.INFORM_WHEN_CONNECTED

Prerequisite
###################

‚ùóAn important prerequisite for the loss of connectivity event (INFORM_WHEN_NOT_CONNECTED) is that while a Network App successfully receives the callback notification from the NEF Emulator, subsequently NEF expects an ``HTTP Response`` with the ``JSON`` content shown below:

.. code-block:: console

   {"ack" : "TRUE"}

As a result, the developer should ensure that in the endpoint that is responsible for receiving the callback notifications (HTTP POST requests) from NEF, Network App always returns the aforementioned acknowledgement, in ``JSON`` format.
