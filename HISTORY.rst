A new method has been implemented with name

With the new method the net app developer has the option to request for location information for a device just once. No need to create subscriptions or maintain a local web server in order to get notified for location changes.
When a call to ``get_location_information`` is made, the 5G-API responds instantly with the location information (the cell id the device, that is being monitored, is connected to)
